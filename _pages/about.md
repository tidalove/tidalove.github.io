I'm Kai, an undergrad at MIT pursuing a B.S. in physics and math. I'm also interested in sustainability, electrical engineering, and math; in my free time, I make art and take care of my turtles. Feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://tidalove.github.io/files/VAN_BRUNT_Kai_2023.pdf) or read about my [projects](https://tidalove.github.io/archive/).
